The project uses the Google Drive API, in order to uset it you'll need to add your own _credentials.json_ file. You can create one 
for a QuickStart in Google's API Introduction Page [here](https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/quickstart/java).

The project currently supports the following operations:

- List the files currently hosted in your Google Drive Account
- Upload and Download Files

Keep in mind that, for the app to upload and download files, the user must give you consent for such operations. Your app must be verified by Google when creating your project.

## Future Improvements
- Optimize the process when uploading a file. (Checking the MIME type)
- Give functionality to the Quick Access panel.

## Inspiration
The design is based on @k33ptoo [original design](https://sellfy.com/p/2FwR/).
